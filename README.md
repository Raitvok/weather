## Weather Application

https://github.com/Raitvok/weather

This application displays the current weather and forecast for six days.<br>
When loading the application displays a weather for Minsk.<br>
**_If you want to find another country, city, type in search his name._**

In the current day, you will see:
 - the date and day.
 - the temperature is current, night and day
 - a description of the weather
 - perceived temperature
 - humidity and visibility
  
The application has been built with help of API. Here you can find the link to it:

When creating the application used the following technologies:
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Grid layout
- JS ES6
- React

I am currently working on improving the application:
- add redux (to exclude the treatment component);
- add weather hour by hour;
